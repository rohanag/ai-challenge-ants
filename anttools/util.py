class Counter(dict):
  """
  A counter keeps track of counts for a set of keys.
  
  The counter class is an extension of the standard python
  dictionary type.  It is specialized to have number values  
  (integers or floats), and includes a handful of additional
  functions to ease the task of counting data.  In particular, 
  all keys are defaulted to have value 0.  Using a dictionary:
  
  a = {}
  print a['test']
  
  would give an error, while the Counter class analogue:
    
  >>> a = Counter()
  >>> print a.getCount('test')
  0
  
  returns the default 0 value. Note that to reference a key 
  that you know is contained in the counter, 
  you can still use the dictionary syntax:
    
  >>> a = Counter()
  >>> a['test'] = 2
  >>> print a['test']
  2
  
  The counter also includes additional functionality useful in implementing
  the classifiers for this assignment.  Two counters can be added,
  subtracted or multiplied together.  See below for details.  They can
  also be normalized and their total count and arg max can be extracted.
  """
  def incrementCount(self, key, count):
    """
    Increases the count of key by the specified count.  If 
    the counter does not contain the key, then the count for
    key will be set to count.
    
    >>> a = Counter()
    >>> a.incrementCount('test', 1)
    >>> a.getCount('hello')
    0
    >>> a.getCount('test')
