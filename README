Hello

This was my quick attempt at designing bots for aichallenge.org

The base algorithm I used was value iteration, modded base code provided by berkeley (http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/pacman/projects/reinforcement/reinforcement.html)

The main file is anttools\myBot.py

Run any of the .bat files.

Enjoy :)
